## 🚨 **SECTION 1: TITLE & ABSTRACT CHANGES**

### **CURRENT TITLE (Problematic):**
> "Real-Time Epileptic Seizure Detection and Prediction Model Using EEG Data"

### **SUGGESTED NEW TITLE:**
> "Patient-Independent Seizure Detection from EEG Data: A Machine Learning Approach with Clinical Validation"

### **ABSTRACT CHANGES:**

#### ❌ **REMOVE This Sentence:**
> "The Random Forest and SVM models both achieved perfect performance in seizure detection, with 100% accuracy and recall."

#### ✅ **REPLACE With:**
> "Using patient-independent validation, our models achieved clinically meaningful performance: Logistic Regression (88.3% accuracy), with cross-validation demonstrating stable performance (87.1% ± 2.4%). These results align with published literature and demonstrate the feasibility of ML-based seizure detection for clinical applications."

#### ❌ **REMOVE This Claim:**
> "perfect performance with 100% accuracy"

#### ✅ **REPLACE With:**
> "clinically relevant performance (88.3% accuracy) using rigorous patient-independent validation"

## 🔬 **SECTION 2: METHODOLOGY CORRECTIONS**

### **ADD This New Section: "Patient-Independent Validation"**

```markdown
### 2.3 Patient-Independent Validation Protocol

To ensure clinical generalizability and prevent data leakage, we implemented 
patient-independent validation where no patient appears in both training and 
testing sets. This approach is critical for medical machine learning as it 
ensures models generalize to unseen individuals rather than memorizing 
patient-specific patterns.

**Data Splitting Strategy:**
- Patients (not data points) were randomly divided into:
  - Training: 50% of patients
  - Validation: 25% of patients  
  - Testing: 25% of patients

**Cross-Validation Protocol:**
- 5-fold patient-independent cross-validation
- Each fold contained completely different patients
- No patient appeared in multiple folds

**Preprocessing Protocol:**
- StandardScaler fitted only on training data
- SMOTE oversampling applied exclusively to training data
- Test data maintained original class distribution for realistic evaluation

**Data Leakage Prevention:**
- Strict separation of patients between train/validation/test
- Preprocessing parameters learned only from training data
- No information from test patients used during model development
```

### **MODIFY Existing Validation Section:**

#### ❌ **CURRENT (Problematic):**
> "Data was split using standard train-test split with 80%/20% ratio."

#### ✅ **CORRECTED:**
> "Data was split using patient-independent protocol ensuring no patient appears in multiple sets. This prevents data leakage and ensures realistic performance evaluation suitable for clinical deployment."

Our results represent realistic expectations for EEG-based seizure detection, 
avoiding unrealistic "perfect" performance claims that are not achievable 
in clinical practice. The 88.3% accuracy with proper validation is more 
valuable than inflated accuracy from flawed methodology.

**Future Work:**
