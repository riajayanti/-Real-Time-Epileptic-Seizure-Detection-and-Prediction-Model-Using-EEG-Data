# Real-Time Epileptic Seizure Detection and Prediction Model Using EEG Data

In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates real-time seizure detection with predictive capabilities, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with intractable epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. For seizure prediction, we employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks capable of modeling temporal dependencies in EEG data. The Random Forest and SVM models both achieved perfect performance in seizure detection, with 100% accuracy and recall. For seizure prediction, the LSTM model demonstrated strong results, achieving an accuracy of 89.26%. These results highlight the value of combining seizure detection and prediction, which leverages both immediate pattern recognition and longer-term temporal dependencies in neural activity. This approach shows promise for improving clinical seizure management and informing the development of accessible, real-time monitoring tools for use outside of traditional healthcare settings.
